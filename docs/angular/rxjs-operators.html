It can be some multiple external data points like Firebase or several UI widgets interacting with a user. Sequence composition is a technique that enables you to create complex queries across multiple data sources by combing relevant streams into one. RxJs provides a variety of operators that can help you do that and in this article we’ll take a look at the most commonly used.</p> <p>I’ve even become part time animation specialist to design and create most intuitive data flow diagrams that demonstrate the difference between all the operators. However, the diagrams are embedded as an animated GIF so it takes a while for all of them to load. Please be patient.</p> <p>In the accompanying code I’ll be using lettable operators so if you’re not familiar with them you can do it <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/lettable-operators.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.

This operator combines a number of observables streams and concurrently emits all values from every given input stream. As values from any combined sequence are produced, those values are emitted as part of the resulting sequence. Such process is often referred to as flattening in documentation.</p> <p>The stream completes when all input streams complete and will throw an error if any of the streams throws an error.

It concatenates streams by subscribing and emitting values from each input stream sequentially having only one active subscription at a time. Once the current stream completes it subscribes to next sequence and passes its values on through to the resulting sequence.</p> <p>The stream completes when all input streams complete and will throw an error if some of the input streams throw an error.

In some scenarios, we may only be interested in the the values from the most recent inner sequence. A good example of such functionality is search. As a user types in some text, the request is sent to a server and since it’s asynchronous the result is returned as an observable. What if the user updates the text in the search-box before the result is returned? The second request is sent and so by now two searches have been sent to the server. However, the first search contains the results that we are no longer interested in. Furthermore, if the result for the first search was merged together with result for the second search, the user would be very surprised. We don’t want that and so this is where switchAll operator comes in. It subscribes and produces values only from the most recent inner sequence ignoring previous streams.</p> <p>In the diagram below you can see the H higher-order stream that produces two inner streams A and B.

Yet, if you think about it, they are almost the same thing. All *Map operators consist of two parts — producing a stream of observables through mapping and applying combination logic on the inner streams produced by this higher order observable.</p> <p>Let’s take a look at the following familiar code that demonstrates how mergeAll operator works:</p> <pre><code>const a = stream('a', 200, 3);
const b = stream('b', 200, 3);
const h = interval(100).pipe(take(2), **map**(i =&gt; [a, b][i]));

h.pipe(**mergeAll**()).subscribe(fullObserver('mergeAll'));
</code></pre> <p>Here map operator produces a stream of observables and mergeAll combines values from these observables and so we can easily replace map and mergeAll with the mergeMap like this:</p> <pre><code>const a = stream('a', 200, 3);
const b = stream('b', 200, 3);
const h = interval(100).pipe(take(2), **mergeMap**(i =&gt; [a, b][i]));

h.subscribe(fullObserver('mergeMap'));
</code></pre> <p>The result will be the exactly the same. The same holds true for both concatMap and switchMap — try it on your own.</p> <h3 id="combing-sequences-by-pairing-their-values"><a href="#combing-sequences-by-pairing-their-values" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Combing sequences by pairing their values</h3> <p>The previous operators allowed us to flatten multiple sequences and deliver values from those sequences unchanged through the resulting stream as if they all come from this one sequence. The set of operators we’ll take a look next still take multiple sequences as an input, but differ in that they pair values from each sequence to produce a single combined value for the output sequence.</p> <p>Each operator can take an optional so-called projection function as the last parameter that defines how the values from the resulting sequence should be combined. In my examples I’ll be using the default projection function that simply joins values using comma as a separator. I’ll show how to provide a custom projection function in the end of the section.</p> <h2 id="combinelatest"><a href="#combinelatest" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> CombineLatest</h2> <p>The first operator we’ll review is combineLatest. It allows you to take the most recent value from input sequences and transform those into one value for the resulting sequence. RxJs caches last value for each input sequence and once all sequences have produced at least one value it computes a resulting value using projection function that takes the latest values from the cache, then emits the output of that computation through the result stream.</p> <p>The resulting stream completes when all inner streams complete and will throw an error if any of the inner streams throws an error. It will never complete if any of the inner streams doesn’t complete. On the other hand, if any stream does not emit value but completes, resulting stream will complete at the same moment without emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from completed input stream in resulting sequence. Also, if some input stream does not emit any value and never completes, combineLatest will also never emit and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some value.</p> <p>This operator can be useful if you need to evaluate some combination of state which needs to be kept up-to-date when part of the state changes. A simple example would be a monitoring system. Each service is represented by a sequence that returns a Boolean indicating the availability of said service. The monitoring status is green if all services are available so the projection function should simply perform a logical AND.</p> <p>In the diagram below you can see the combineLatest operator combining two streams A and B.

It brings together two or more sequences of <em>corresponding</em> values as a tuple (a pair in case of two input streams). It waits for the corresponding value to be emitted from all input streams, then transforms them into a single value using projection function and emits the result. It will only publish once it has a pair of fresh values from each source sequence so if one of the source sequences publishes values faster than the other sequence, the rate of publishing will be dictated by the slower of the two sequences.</p> <p>The resulting stream completes when any of the inner streams complete and the corresponding matched pairs are emitted from other streams. It will never complete if any of the inner streams doesn’t complete and will throw an error if any of the inner streams errors out.</p> <p>This operator can be conveniently used to implement a stream that produces a range of values with an interval. Here is the basic example with the projection function returning values only from the range stream:</p> <pre><code>zip(range(3, 5), interval(500), v =&gt; v).subscribe();
